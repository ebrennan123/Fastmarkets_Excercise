# Fastmarkets_Excercise

Within this example I will demonstrate how I created a complete Linux environment on a virtual machine and its supporting resources using Terraform on Azure. 
I have created the following resources: 

 - Virtual Network
 - Subnet
 - Public ID Address
 - Network Security Group with SSH inbound rule
 - Virtual Network Interface Card
 -  Storage Account for Boot Diagnostics
 - SSH Key
 - Virtual Machine

With this example I wanted to demonstrate my knowledge of the resource types available on Microsoft Azure as well as my understanding of what Terraform is, what it does and its advantages to CI/CD development. 

Terraform is an infrastructure as a code tool (IAC) which allows us to manage infrastructure through configuration files rather than with a GUI. Terraform allows us to write human readable configuration files which allow us to write infrastructure code quickly and promotes workflow automation, this overall will speed up the process of CI/CD development with DevOPs.
